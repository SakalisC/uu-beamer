This is a beamer theme based on the very nice UU theme I got from Ricardo Alves.
I also took some latex code from Andre Hilsendeger.

To use the theme simply put all the files in in your presentation directory. The
is an example presentation included.

You can override the "it.uu.se" string by `\renewcommand{\uuurl}{some string}`.
